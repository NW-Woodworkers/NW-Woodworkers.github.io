			<h1>Northwest Woodworkers Association</h1>
			<p>
				The Northwest Woodworkers Association is a forum for woodworkers of all skill levels to share their common interests.  Our members interests cover all aspects of woodworking including: carving, turning, furniture, cabinetry, marquetry, scroll work, and many others.  The group meets monthly.  Our meetings are usually held at the Seattle Woodcraft store.  The Northwest Woodworkers Association was known as the Northwest Woodworkers Guild.

Anyone interested in working with wood and sharing their ideas and experiences is welcome.
